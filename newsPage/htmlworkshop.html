            <p>The computer engineering department of Goa College of Engineering, Farmagudi conducted a one-day technical workshop on 24th of September 2016. The workshop was focused on HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Ashish Narvekar and Sweta Morajkar, Assistant Professors from Goa College of Engineering were the resource persons for the day, coordinated by Teslin Jacob and Nitesh Naik, GEC. Hands-on training was conducted for the first year students of Goa College of Engineering. 
          </p>
            <p>HTML and CSS knowledge is the starting point for web development which is the current trend. Students were given practical sessions starting with HTML which is used to define the basic structure and content of a website. This was followed by CSS which is used to describe the presentation and visual style of a webpage. HTML/CSS can be picked up by anybody irrespective of their field of study. Students were then encouraged to take further lessons in web development and develop their own websites. Such workshops and trainings provide the students a good exposure to the current IT industry requirements and standards and get them well acquainted with new technologies and platforms currently in use.   The department has plans to conduct further workshops for its students on currents trends and technologies keeping in mind the market value of such knowledge.
