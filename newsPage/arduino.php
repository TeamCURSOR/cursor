            <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is intended for anyone making interactive projects. Day 1 of workshop basically included introducing the students to arduino. The workshop was divided into three parts: Hardware, Software and Interfacing Modules. The Hardware part included giving a brief overview of different parts of arduino and their functioning as well as different parts of the device and itâ€™s working. Software part included introducing students to basic C and also explaining the syntax used to program arduino. Topics covered were manipulating digitak signals, analog signals, using delays, counters and serial communication. Day 2 started with a short test, where students had to implement the program on their arduino kits. The students were taught how to use modules and there was demonstration of a project on controlling real world with arduino.
